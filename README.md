# stupid calculator

### HOW IT WORKS

### choose a number 1-4 (addition, substraction, multiplication, division)

### choose any number (at least two pls)

that's just a stupid calculator, a simple project made by me

it is **slow**

idk why but I don't care tbh, because it *works*



I'm a teenager, don't expect a lot from me

idk even how GitHub works tbh


made with ![WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl-badge-4.png), because it's awesome
